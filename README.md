    <h1>Particle Collision</h1>
</div>

This is a project I built when I was first learning Python! I have made modifications since. This project simulates the collision of particles in a box.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:

* [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/)
* Optional: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (which greatly simplifies the installation process)

## Installation
Once you have downloaded the files, open up a terminal and navigate to the project directory by running:

* `cd path/to/particle-collision` on Linux or MacOS, or
* `cd path\to\particle-collision` on Windows.

To set up a virtual environment, which will be placed in the folder `particle-collision`:

`python -m venv ./venv`

To activate it run:

* `./venv/bin/activate` on Linux or MacOS,
* `.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat` in Command Prompt on Windows, or
* `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` in PowerShell on Windows.

Next, install the prerequisites into the virtual environment:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Finally, launch the Jupyter Notebook by typing:

`jupyter notebook`

This opens the notebook in your browser ready to run.
